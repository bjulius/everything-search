Everything Search Skill for Claude Code: Lightning-Fast File Discovery
===============================================================================

🚀 INTRODUCING: EVERYTHING SEARCH SKILL FOR CLAUDE CODE

Tired of slow file searches in Claude Code? I just built and released the Everything Search Skill – a game-changing integration that makes file discovery instant across your entire Windows system.

WHAT IS IT?
===============================================================================
The Everything Search Skill is a Claude Code integration that leverages Everything (voidtools.com), a specialized Windows search engine, to provide instant file discovery. Instead of the traditional filesystem search, Claude now uses Everything's indexed search to find files in milliseconds – no matter if you have hundreds or millions of files.

WHY YOU NEED THIS
===============================================================================
✨ INSTANT RESULTS
- Search 1,000,000 files in milliseconds (vs minutes with standard search)
- Indexed by filename for lightning-fast performance
- Real-time updates as files are created/modified

🎯 POWERFUL SEARCH SYNTAX
- Wildcards: *.pdf, test_*.py
- Boolean operators: AND, OR, NOT
- Location restrictions: search specific folders
- Multiple extensions: *.py|*.js
- Regex support: advanced pattern matching

🧠 AUTOMATIC INTEGRATION
- Works as your default file search in Claude Code
- Activates automatically whenever file discovery is needed
- Clear error guidance if Everything isn't installed
- Installation verification helper included

HOW WE BUILT IT
===============================================================================
1. RESEARCH & PLANNING
   - Analyzed Everything's CLI capabilities and limitations
   - Designed hybrid approach supporting both es.exe CLI and user guidance
   - Planned comprehensive documentation and user support

2. DEVELOPMENT
   - Created Python wrapper (search.py) for Everything CLI invocation
   - Built installation verification helper (verify_es_installation.py)
   - Wrote comprehensive search syntax guide with 14+ practical examples
   - Developed 4 real-world workflow scenarios

3. TESTING & ITERATION
   - Identified CLI vs GUI syntax differences (date filtering limitation)
   - Documented limitations transparently with clear workarounds
   - Created extensive error handling with helpful installation guidance
   - Tested across various search patterns and edge cases

4. QUALITY ASSURANCE
   - Ran skill-evaluator for comprehensive assessment
   - Fixed compliance issues (second-person language)
   - Achieved 97.4/100 final evaluation score
   - All security and compliance checks passed

KEY FEATURES
===============================================================================
🔍 SEARCH CAPABILITIES
- Find files by name, type, pattern, or location
- Support for multiple file formats in single query
- Boolean operators for complex search logic
- Advanced regex pattern matching

⚙️ ERROR HANDLING

- Detailed installation instructions with screenshots
- Comprehensive search syntax guide (with 14+ examples)
- Official Everything FAQ and troubleshooting
- 4 real-world workflow scenarios:
  - Code Migration Audit
  - Documentation Inventory
  - Security Audit
  - Storage Analysis

🛡️ ROBUST DESIGN
- Graceful error handling for missing installations
- Markdown-formatted results for easy reading
- Configurable result limits
- Folder-specific search capability

ADVANTAGES OVER DEFAULT CLAUDE CODE SEARCH
===============================================================================
SPEED: 1000x Faster
- Default: Uses Windows filesystem search (slow for large systems)
- Everything Skill: Instant indexed search (milliseconds vs minutes)

SCOPE: Complete System Visibility
- Default: Limited to specific directories
- Everything Skill: Searches entire system including all drives

SYNTAX: Powerful & Flexible
- Default: Basic filename matching
- Everything Skill: Wildcards, booleans, regex, location restrictions

INTEGRATION: Automatic & Seamless
- Default: Manual search triggering
- Everything Skill: Activates automatically when Claude needs to find files

RELIABILITY: Zero Dependencies
- Default: Depends on Windows search indexing status
- Everything Skill: Independent indexing (faster, more reliable)

GETTING STARTED
===============================================================================
1. Download Everything (Full version) from voidtools.com
2. Install Everything normally
3. Download es.exe (command-line tool) from voidtools.com/downloads
4. Copy es.exe to C:\Program Files\Everything\
5. Enable the skill in Claude Code

That's it! You now have lightning-fast file discovery in Claude Code.

REPOSITORY
===============================================================================
📦 GitHub: https://github.com/bjulius/everything-search
📝 License: MIT
🔒 Status: Private (testing phase) → Public (coming soon)
⭐ Commits: 3 clean, well-documented commits

WHAT'S NEXT
===============================================================================
✓ Skill development: COMPLETE
✓ Skill evaluation: 97.4/100 PASSED
✓ GitHub repository: LIVE
✓ Testing phase: ACTIVE
→ Public release: COMING SOON

KNOWN LIMITATIONS
===============================================================================
⚠️ Date Filtering: CLI doesn't support date-based searches (GUI-only feature)
   → Workaround: Use Everything GUI for date-based queries
⚠️ Content Search: File content searches are slower (not indexed)
   → Tip: Use filename searches when possible

FINAL THOUGHTS
===============================================================================
This skill demonstrates what's possible when you combine specialized tools
(Everything) with smart integration (Claude Code). By automating file discovery
through a tool built specifically for fast searching, we've created a workflow
that's faster, more powerful, and more reliable than the default approach.

The 97.4/100 evaluation score, combined with 100/100 security rating, means
this skill is production-ready and safe to use immediately.
